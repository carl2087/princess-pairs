Princess Pairs is a website where you can play a card matching game. On page load the princess cards fade to black and there is a modal with simple instructions on how to play the game. There is a move counter at the bottom of the page that remembers your lowest move tally. When a princess is matched the card reveals a flower and when all princesses are found a modal appears congratylating you and asks if you want to try and beat your move tally.

The primary goal of the website is to provide a simple fun game to play for children.
